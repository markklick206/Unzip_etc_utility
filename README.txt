DESCRIPTION: This windows batch script makes life a lot easier when trying to unzip .zip or .jar files of student assignmnets that are downloaded from Sakai, i.e., the bulk_download .zip file Sakai outputs.

This script takes a file directory as an argument and uses 7zip to unzip all the .zip and .jar files present in the directory.

USAGE:
unzip_hw_zip_and_jar C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Intro_prog_java\week6\bulk_download

TODO: add an option to delete the .zip and .jar files after unzipping them
